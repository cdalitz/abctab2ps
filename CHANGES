      the stroke can optionally be suppressed with %%nogracestroke)
      and more than one note means "sixteenth notes"

    o when a length is specified it applies to all grace notes
      in the same brace pair. When more than one length is given,

 - first bar number suppressed in tablature (now same as in music)

 - no longer double bar labels when label on last bar in line.
   Label on last bar in line is always moved to beginning of next
   line. To suppress this, put the label on an invisible bar
   before the last bar in the line.

   determined due to inproperly closed header. abctab2ps now stops
   and reports stopping point in abc file instead.

 - trailing comma in tab chords no longer causes erroneous postscript


Version 1.8.0, Apr 23 2007
--------------------------

 - printing of metronome marks (Q:...) for abc2midi can be

 - changes to M: field
    o removed support for undocumented modifiers 's' and 'l'

       ';' for annularius, '+' for pollix)
     o trill ('#') and appogiatura (''') signs

   except for the following additional features:
     o new clef "treble8" (modern tenor clef)
     o support for figured bass as "stacked guitar chords"
       "\n" creates a line break in a guitar chord, eg
          "6\n4"D "5\n3#"D,
       Not more than one line break is possible.

 - support for ten course french tablature

 - detailed user's guide and man page


TODO in future versions
-----------------------

 - M:none can result in 4/4 in tablature rather than none
   (example file???)

 - crescendo and decrescondo signs with !crescendo(! etc.

 - ligatura brackets must be shifted up when high slurs below bracket
   (see music.cpp::draw_bracket())

 - include tabfonts only when necessary

 - "historicstyle" should also effect clefs and rests

 - Q: field should be possible inline

 - have a look at note length after dotted rhythms in tablature ">"

 - improve default values for topmargin/topspace

 - include bordun slashes in french tabfonts
   (scales better and takes care of letter widths)

 - make transpose a format parameter to allow for transposition
   of individual tunes

 - option to transpose figured bass

 - fullbar repeats (how to code in abc??)

 - remove hard coded limitation on filename lengths

 - replace writing output file (PUT0 etc) with fprintf()
   (fixes BUFSZ limits)

 - scope %%leftmargin is current page, not current tune

 - pseudocomment option for different staffwidth in last line

 - new decorations !invertedfermata! resp. !note+fermata!
   for fermata below staff resp. fermata over flag in tab
   new decoration !open! for flageoletts

 - new escape sequences \5 and \6 in gchords
   (figbass shorthand notation for diminished chords)

 - support for invisible rests in tabrhstyle grid
   problem: symbol type is reset from REST to NOTE
   more analysis of abc2ps code required

 - change of first page for page numbering with %%firstpage
   (better solution realized with script pspage)

 - scordatura signs
   (in analogy to global accidentals in music) 

 - problem if %%tabfontsize in first tune different from next
   tunes; solution: do not anchor tabfontsize in PS-macros
