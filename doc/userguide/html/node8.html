Tablature
</H1>
Lines of lute or guitar tablature are distinguished from music lines 
by the particular clefs <I>frenchtab, french4tab, french5tab, 
italiantab, italian7tab, italian8tab, italian4tab, italian5tab,
spanishtab, guitartab, spanish4tab, spanish5tab, banjo4tab, ukuleletab, 
germantab, neapoltab</I> or <I>banjo5tab</I>. Like usual clefs, 
they can be specified in the K: field or in the clef parameter of 
a voice definition.
The different clefs specify the following types of tablature:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>frenchtab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In french tablature, the top line stands for the
highest course. The frets at which the courses are stopped are given
by <I>letters</I>: <I>a</I> stands for an empty string, <I>b</I> for the first
fret etc. The letters are printed <I>between</I> the lines.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>french4tab, french5tab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Like <I>frenchtab</I>, but with four resp.
five tablature lines; one more course than tab lines is supported.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>spanishtab, guitartab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In spanish tablature, the top line stands for the
highest course. The frets at which the courses are stopped are given
by <I>numbers</I>: <I>0</I> stands for an empty string, <I>1</I> for the first
fret etc. The numbers are printed <I>on</I> the lines. This tablature 
was used by spanish vihuelists; nowadays it
is quite common as <I>guitar tablature</I>. Spanish tablature does not
support more than six courses.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>spanish5tab, banjo5tab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Similar to <I>spanishtab</I>, but five tablature
lines; not more than five courses.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>spanish4tab, banjo4tab, ukuleletab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Similar to <I>spanishtab</I>, but 
four tablature lines; not more than four courses.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>neapoltab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Similar to <I>spanishtab</I>, but fret numbers start with 1
instead of 0.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>italiantab, italian7tab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In italian tablature, the top line stands 
for the lowest course, which makes this tablature more difficult to learn 
in the beginning. The frets at which the courses are stopped are given
by <I>numbers</I>: <I>0</I> stands for an empty string, <I>1</I> for the first
fret etc. The numbers are printed <I>on</I> the lines. If you want
to notate bourdon strings in italian tablature, you must specify
<I>italian7tab</I> rather than <I>italiantab</I>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>italian8tab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Additionally to <I>italian7tab</I>, stopped courses on
the eighth course are possible. This results in more space between
tabstaff and flags, which might be compensated with a negative value
for <I>%%tabflagspace</I>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>italian4tab, italian5tab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Like <I>italiantab</I>, but with four resp.
five tablature lines; not more than four resp five courses.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>germantab</STRONG></DT>
<DD>German lute tablature without staff lines and unique
  letters for each fret/course combination. Historically, German tablature
  only supports six courses; higher courses are drawn by abctab2ps like
  in <EM>frenchtab</EM>.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00081000000000000000">
Course and fret</A>
</H2>
As for music, simultanously plucked strings are written within 
chord brackets "[]". Each position in the bracket marks a specific
course: the first character refers to the first course, the second
character to the second course etc. If the specific course is
unplucked, write a comma ","; is it unstopped write <I>a</I>; is it
stopped in the first fret write <I>b</I> etc. If all subsequent courses
are unplucked, you can end the chord.

<P>
If a tablature chord consists of only one plucked string the chord
brackets can be omitted. If a chord only contains commas (eg. &ldquo;,1&rdquo; or
&ldquo;[,2]&rdquo;), only the rhythm flag is printed.

<P>
The following example shows the notation of a tablature chord and
its output in frenchtab and spanishtab (guitartab):

</DIV>

<P>
Remarks:

<OL>
<LI>This "french tablature notation" with letters for the 
frets is the same for <I>all</I> tablature styles. Depending on the
chosen tabstyle in the clef specification, the output will differ.
Numbers for the frets in the input format cannot be used for two reasons:

<UL>
<LI>numbers are already used in the abc language for rhythm
</LI>
<LI>frets higher than ten would not be accessible because the numbers
were two characters wide
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>In french tablature, the letter "j" is not used. Consequently, 
the letter "k" means the 9th fret etc.
</LI>
</OL>
<A ID="423"></A> <A ID="424"></A>
<I>Bourdon strings</I> or <I>"diapasons"</I> are written in braces 
"{}". You can use both the ledger line notation for courses 7 to 10
and the number notation; eg. "{„,a}" and "{10}" both mean
the tenth course, where the first notation results in an "a" with three
ledger lines and the second results in an "X".

<P>
Please note that braces indicate grace notes in music lines. 
Since grace notes are not supported in tablature, braces are abused in 
tablature notation.

<P>
<A ID="427"></A> <A ID="428"></A>
In german lute tablature, the symbols used for the sixth course (&ldquo;Brummer&rdquo;)
vary from print to print: some use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A B C D ...</SPAN>, some 
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">1 A B C ...</SPAN> and others <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">1 2 3 4 ...</SPAN>, where the numbers
are crossed through. You can choose the style with teh format parameter
<I>%%tabbrummer</I> which can be one of <I>ABC</I>, <I>1AB</I> or <I>123</I>.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00082000000000000000"></A>

<BR>
Rhythm
</H2>
As for music, the length of a note is specified by a factor with
respect to the default length (L: field). In contrast to music chords
which require the length factor after the <I>first</I> note in a chord,
tablature chords require the length factor after the <I>last</I> note
of a chord.

<P>
An other important difference concerns the interpretation of chords
without any note length factor. In music, these chords inherit their
length from the default length specified in the L: field. In tablature,
these chords inherit their length from the length of the previous chord
and the rhythm flag is omitted in the printed output (unless you explicitly
ask for a flag on every note with <I>%%taballflags</I>). This means that you 
must specify the length factor "1" if you want a flag above a chord
of the default length.

<P>
The shortcuts "<code>&gt;</code>" and "<code>&lt;</code>" for dotting work like in 
music lines.

<P>
The code for triplets and general <I>n</I>-plets is the 
<a href="same as in music,#same as in music, (see section .)">sec:MusicRhythm</a>, eg. "(3[a,bc1]cd".

<P>
<A ID="446"></A>
There is no consistent way for the notation of rests in tablature:
most historic sources draw a flag with no fret letters, while modern
editions often use modern rest signs. Which rests abctab2ps draws
depends on the 
<a href="tabrhstyle#tabrhstyle (see section .)">sec:TabFormatParameters</a>:
in &ldquo;modern&rdquo; and &ldquo;modernbeams&rdquo; style, abctab2ps draws modern style rests;
in all other style
old style rests are drawn. If you need an flag without letter in tabrhstyle
modern, you can use empty chords, eg. &ldquo;,1&rdquo; or &ldquo;[,2]&rdquo;.

<P>
Like tablature chords, rests inherit their length from the previous 
chord or rest and they are only drawn if they explicitly have a rhythm 
factor. Moreover, invisible rests are indicated by <I>x</I>.

Decorations
</H2>
In music, the abc language only knows graces that affect an 
<I>entire chord</I>. While this is ok for most decorations, there
are some tablature grace signs (eg. appoggiatura) that apply to a 
<I>single note of a chord</I>. Thus there are two ways to specify
a tablature decoration:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>If the magic character (eg. 'H' for fermata) stands <I>outside</I>
    and <I>immediately before</I> a chord, the decoration applies to the 
    entire chord. If that decoration usually is associated to a single
    note (eg. appoggiatura or vibrato), it applies to the <I>top note</I>
    of the chord.
</LI>
<LI>If the magic character (eg. '#' for vibrato) stands <I>inside</I>
    chord brackets, it applies to the note immediately following that
    magic character. Beware however, that some decorations like fermata 
    cannot be applied to single notes; these decorations are ignored 
    when they appear within chord brackets.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The following table lists all graces supported in tablature and whether
they may appear within chord brackets ("applies to chord/note"):

Text below notes
</H2>
The "guitar chord" notation of text enclosed in double quotes
(<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">"</SPAN>) can be used in tablature too. In tablature however, the
text is printed <I>below</I> the tablature system rather than <I>above</I>,
because otherwise it would interfere with the rhythm flags.

<P>
"Guitar chords" in tablature typically are not used for actual
guitar chord symbols, but for other stuff eg. left/right hand fingering.
Like in music, "guitar chords" can contain line breaks,
indicated by <code>\n</code>.

Beams, ties and slurs
</H2>
Like in music, ties to the next note can be notatetd with a dash "-"
and more general slurs with parenthesis "()". There is a significant 
difference however: in music, slur bows are also used to indicate 
phrasing and more than one slur can start at a single note. In 
tablature, slur bows always mean "slur" and not more than one slur
may start on a single note, nor may slurs be stacked. Like in music however,
slurs inside and outside of chords are different kinds of animals.

<P>
Here are some examples for tablature slurs:
Please note, that the first tie in the second example is not possible in 
music because the opening parenthesis in the chord is not immediately 
closed in the next note.

<LI>The first tie in the second example is not possible in music 
    because the opening parenthesis in the chord is not immediately

</LI>
<LI>In the third example the slur ends on an unplucked course.
    This is achieved by using the letter 'y' (which is not implemented in the
    tablature font) as an anchor for the slur.
</LI>
</UL>
Beams in the tablature rhythm flags are only drawn when the
rhythm style is set to <I>%%tabrhstyle grid</I> or <I>modernbeams</I> (see 
<a href="Format parameters#section ">sec:TabFormatParameters</a>).
When this rhythm style is set, the rhythm flags of notes which are
grouped together without white space are connected with beams.
This results in grid shaped rhythm flags as used in some english
16c manuscript sources.

Tenuto strokes
</H2>
Tenuto strokes indicating held notes are drawn with <code>!ten(!</code> 
for the start of a tenuto and <code>!ten)!</code> for the end of a tenuto.
These marks are only allowed <EM>inside chord brackets</EM>. To let them start
or end on an unplucked course, use the invisible fret symbol <EM>y</EM>.

<LI>The font parameters <I>tabfont*</I> are <I>global</I> settings
    which cannot be changed between different tunes (X:) within
    a single abc file.
</LI>
<LI>The choice of <I>tabrhstyle</I> affects the implicit default value of
    <I>tabaddflags</I>: for "simple" tabrhstyle the latter is 2, otherwise
    it defaults to 0. To override these defaults, simply set <I>tabaddflags</I>

Tablature Fonts
</H2>
abctab2ps reads the font files for tablature letters or numbers
from the directory specified by the environment variable <I>ABCTABFONTS</I>.
Font file names consist of the name of the composer who used this font
and the prefix <I>fr</I> (like "french") for letter fonts, <I>it</I>
(like "italian") for number fonts or <I>de</I> (like "deutsch") for german
tablature fonts. Font file names are case
sensitive and only the third character is uppercase. Valid font
names are eg.<PRE>
frFrancisque
itBorrono
deFraktur
</PRE>
In the abc file you can specify the desired font files with the
pseudocomments <I>%%tabfontfrench</I>, <I>%%tabfontitalian</I> and
<I>%%tabfontgerman</I>, where
the prefix in the font file name optionally may be omitted.
Note that different fonts look best at different sizes: eg.
<I>frFrancisque</I> should be at least 14pt, while <I>itBorrono</I>
looks better at 13pt. Thus, when experimenting with different fonts
you should experiment with different values for <I>%%tabfontsize</I>
and <I>%%tabfontscale</I> too.

<P>
If you you have some minimal postscript knowledge, you can easily 
define your own tablature font: start with a given font file
and replace the drawing routines for the individual letters or
numbers with your own postscript routines. A font file with the
prefix <I>fr</I> must define the postscript font <I>FrenchTabfont</I>,
which is used in the drawing routines for french tablature.
A font file with the prefix <I>it</I> must define the postscript font
<I>ItalianTabfont</I>, which is used in the drawing routines for
italian and spanish tablature.

<P>
The drawing routines
in the default fonts are defined in a 20x20 system, you can change
this with a different <I>/FontBBox</I> statement. For each character
symbol, you should leave some top space in order to prevent the letters 
from touching each other. Additional bottom space for French fonts is not 
necessary because abctab2ps puts one point space between tablature lines
and the symbols.

<P>
In order to make abctab2ps interpret your self defined font correctly,
you must adhere to the following encoding scheme for frenchtab and
italiantab (spanishtab):
