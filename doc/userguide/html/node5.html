Key and Clef
</H2>
Key and clef are usually specified in the K: field. In 
<a href="multi stave music,#multi stave music, (see section .)">sec:MultiStaveMusic</a> the clef is specified in the V: field.
For a key change inmidst a music line, use the inline version <code>[K:]</code>.

<P>
The general form of a K: field is:<PRE>
K:&lt;key and mode&gt; &lt;global accidentals&gt; [clef=]&lt;clef and octave&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Every option in the K: field may be omitted, but the order must not
be permutated. The meaning of the individual options is:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>key and mode:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The key signature should be  specified  with  a 
capital letter (major mode) which  may  be  followed  by  
a  "#" or "b" for sharp or flat respectively. The mode determines
the accidentals and can follow immediately after the key letter
or with white spaces separated; possible mode names are 
<I>maj(or)</I> (this is the default), <I>min(or), m(inor), ion(ian),
mix(olydian), dor(ian), phr(ygian), lyd(ian), loc(rian), aeo(lian)</I>.
Mode names are not case sensitive.
<BR>
When key and mode are omitted <I>C major</I> is assumed.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>global accidentals:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Global accidentals are accidentals that
always override key specific accidentals. For  example, "K:D =c"
would write the key signature as two sharps (key of D) but then mark
every c as natural  (which  is
conceptually  the same as D mixolydian).  Note that the there can
be several global  accidentals,  separated  by  spaces  and  each
specified  with  an  accidental, __,  _, =, ˆ  or ˆ ˆ , 
followed by a  letter  in  lower  case.  Global  accidentals  are
overridden  by  accidentals  attached to notes within the body of
the abc tune and are reset by each change of signature.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>clef and octave:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The clef specification must be the last word
in the key field. Optionally it may start with a "clef=" prefix.
Classical Western music notation has only three clef signs (G, F
and C) which can appear on different music lines. abctab2ps supports
the following clef names: <I>treble</I> (G on line 2; this
is the default), <I>treble8</I> (like <I>treble</I>, but with an "8" 
printed below), <I>treble8up</I> (like <I>treble</I>, but with an "8" 
printed above), <I>frenchviolin</I> (G on line 1), <I>bass</I> (F on line 4),
<I>varbaritone</I> (F on line 3), <I>subbass</I> (F on line 5),
<I>alto</I> (C on line 3), <I>tenor</I> (C on line 4), 
<I>baritone</I> (C on line 5), <I>soprano</I> (C on line 1), 
<I>mezzosoprano</I> (C on line 2).
<BR>
Optionally the clef may contain an appended octave modifier 
(eg. "treble-8"), which changes the pitch interpretation (see next section).

<H2><A ID="SECTION00052000000000000000"></A>

Pitch
</H2>
Pitches are specified by the letters A-G and a-g, optionally followed
by an apostrophe or a comma. Capital letters denote the lower octave
on the staff. An apostrophe raises the pitch by one octave, a comma
lowers the pitch by one octave. These codes are illustrated below:

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
<IMG STYLE="" SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{sample1}">

</DIV>

<P>
<A ID="122"></A>
Note how the clef influences the default octave. 
The default octave can be lowered or raised with the modifier "-8" or
"+8" after the clef in the K: field, e.g. "K:D treble-8". To reset
the octave modifier, use "[K:treble+0]".

<P>
<A ID="123"></A> <A ID="124"></A> <A ID="125"></A> <A ID="126"></A>
The symbols =,ˆ  and _  are  used  (before  a  note)  to  generate
respectively a natural, sharp or flat. 
Double sharps and flats are available with ˆ ˆ  and __ respectively.

Rhythm
</H2>
By default, a letter generates a note with the default length,
specified in the L: info field. If a the letter is followed by /
or /2, the length is halved. If the letter is followed by an integer,
the length is multiplied. Both modifiers can be combined, so that
the multiplier 3/2 produces a dot.

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
<IMG STYLE="" SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{sample2}">

</DIV>

<P>
<A ID="136"></A> For dotted rhythms 
there is a shorthand notation: "<code>&gt;</code>" means
`the previous note is dotted, the next note halved' and "<code>&lt;</code>" means
`the previous note is halved, the next dotted'. Similarly, "<code>&gt;&gt;</code>"
and "<code>&lt;&lt;</code>" can be used for double dotting.

<P>
<A ID="137"></A>
Rests are generated with a <I>z</I> and can be modified in 
length  in exactly the same way as notes can.

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
<IMG STYLE="" SRC="img3.png"

<A ID="142"></A>
Invisible rests are generated with a <I>x</I>. These count like regular 
rests, but they are not printed. This can be useful in multistave 
music, eg. if one voice has a longer pickup than another voice.

<P>
<A ID="144"></A>
Multi bar rests are generated with a capital <I>Z</I> followed by the
number of bars. When using bar numbering (command line option &ldquo;-k&rdquo; or
format parameter <I>%%barnumbers</I>), abctab2ps takes care of multi bar
rests.

<P>
<A ID="147"></A> Triplets can be simply coded with the notation "(3abc".
Similarly, "(2ab" makes a duplet, "(4abcd" a quadruplet, etc., 
up to "(9". The musical meanings are:

If the time signature is compound (3/8, 6/8, 9/8, 3/4, etc.) then
<I>n</I> is three, otherwise <I>n</I> is two.

<P>
<A ID="155"></A>
More general tuplets can be specified using the syntax <I>(p:q:r</I>
which  means `put <I>p</I> notes into the time of <I>q</I> for the next <I>r</I>
notes'. If <I>q</I>  is not given, it defaults as above. If <I>r</I> is not
given,  it  defaults  to <I>p</I>.  For example, "(3:2:2" is equivalent to
"(3::2" and "(3:2:3" is equivalent to "(3:2", "(3" or even 
"(3::". This
can  be  useful  to  include  notes of different lengths within a
tuplet, for example "(3:2:2G4c2" or "(3:2:4G2A2Bc" and also describes
more precisely how the simple syntax works in cases like "(3D2E2F2"
or even "(3D3EF2". The number written over the tuplet is <I>p</I>.

<P>
<A ID="164"></A> <A ID="165"></A>
The notation of nonmetric music like plainchant requires <I>stemless notes</I>.
These can be enforced with the format parameter <I>%%nostems</I>.
Note that notes still have lengths, so that it is in principle possible
to notate nonmetric music with more than one part (like medieval organa).
To adjust the notes vertically, use invisible rests (<I>x</I>). Invisible
rests can also be used for separating note groups in monophonic stemless
notation. If you only need some stemless notes, use the decoration
<I>!nostem!</I>.

Bars and repeats

Bar lines are specified with a "<code>|</code>". abctab2ps does no 
plausibility check whether a bar is over or underfull, so you can 
put bar lines where you please. The following symbols are supported:

<P>
Invisible bars lines are workarounds if you need labels on the
first bar or put a line break in the middle of a bar.

<P>
First and second repeats can be generated with the symbols "<code>[1</code>" 
and "<code>[2</code>",  e.g.<PRE>
faf gfe|[1 dfe dBA:|[2 d2e dcB|]
</PRE>
When adjacent to bar lines, these can be shortened to 
"<code>|1</code>" and "<code>:|2</code>", but with  regard  to
spaces, i.e. "<code>| [1</code>" is legal, "<code>| 1</code>" is not.
If you want a dot after the number in first and second repeats, use
the format parameter <I>%%endingdots</I>.

Beams, ties and slurs, ligaturae
</H2>
To group notes together under one beam  they  should  be  grouped
together without spaces. Thus in 2/4, "A2BC" will produce an eighth
note followed by two sixteenth notes under one beam whilst "A2 B C"
will  produce  the  same notes separated. It is possible to put 
rests (z) under a beam, e.g "aza". The beam slopes and the
choice of upper or lower staffs are generated automatically.

<P>
<A ID="186"></A> <A ID="187"></A>
You can tie two notes together either across or within a bar with
a  "-" symbol, e.g. "<code>abc-|cba</code>" or "<code>abc-cba</code>". 
More general slurs can be put in with "()" symbols.  Thus "(DEFG)" 
puts a slur  over  the  four notes.  Spaces within a slur are ok, e.g. 
"(D E F G)", but the open bracket  should  come  immediately  
before a note (and its accents/accidentals,  etc.)  and  the  close  
bracket should come immediately after a note (and its octave 
marker or length).  Thus "(=b c'2)" is correct but ( =b c'2 ) is not.

<P>
To abctab2ps, slurs outside chords and slurs within chords are 
different kinds of animals. A slur outside of chord brackets always
applies to the top notes of the enclosed chords and it may span
several notes. A slur within chord brackets however must be 
closed in the immediately following chord. E.g. in order to
tie the top note of a chord to the next single note, you may write
"([afd] b)" or "[(afd] [b)]", but not "[(afd] b)" (in the last
version, the slur is opened inside chord but closed outside which
is not allowed).

<P>
<A ID="188"></A>
In transcriptions of mensural notation into common music notation
<I>ligaturae</I> are often indicated by square brackets. This is possible
with the pseudocomment <I>%%slurisligatura</I>, which prints ligatura
brackets instead of slurs. Note that this only applies to slurs outside
chords and not to ties.

Graces and decorations
</H2>
Grace notes can be written by enclosing them in curly braces (<code>{}</code>):

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
<IMG STYLE="" SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{sample4a}">

</DIV>

<P>
The first two examples show the meaning of grace notes according to the 
abc standard, which specifies that grace notes have no explicit time values
and the following meaning:

<UL>
<LI>A single grace note is an accacciatura
  (see the second example above). In <EM>abctab2ps</EM>, the stroke through
  the flag can optionally be suppressed with the format parameter 
  <EM>%%nogracestroke</EM>.
</LI>
<LI>Multiple grace notes are drawn as beamed sixteenth notes.
</LI>
</UL>
This does not allow for the notation of long appoggiaturas. To overcome this
limitation, <EM>abctab2ps</EM> allows for a length specifier in the grace notes
(see the third example above).
The length applies to all grace notes within the same pair of braces; when 
more than one length is specified, the last length holds (see the last example
above).

<P>
When the following note is a chord, appogiaturas and accacciaturas
are tied to the first note given in the chord.

<P>
Other decorations are indicated either by a magic character (e.g. "T" for a
trill) or by their name in exclamation marks (e.g. "!trill!").
The decoration signs must appear immediately before a note, e.g.
"TG" or "!trill!G" for a trill above middle G. If notes are grouped in chords,
the decoration sign must appear outside and immediately before the chord.
abctab2ps currently supports the following decorations:

Chords
</H2>
Chords (i.e. more than one note head on a  single  stem)  can  be
coded  with brackets ([]) around the notes, e.g. "[CEGc]" produces the
chord  C  major.  They  can  be  grouped   in   beams,   e.g.
"[d2f2][ce][df]" but there should be no spaces within a chord.
A chord with two identical notes makes a unison (one head
with stems going both up and down), eg: "[AA]".

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt218">Important notice:</SPAN> The old style chord notation with
plus signs, eg. "+ac+", which was an undocumented non standard abc 
feature of <I>abc2ps</I> is no longer supported in abctab2ps.

<P>
The abc notation formally permits notes with different durations 
on the same stem: "[a/bc2]" and so on. However, abctab2ps assigns all
notes in a chord the duration of the first note in the bracket.
If you are looking for <I>polyphonie</I>, see the remark on 
<a href="abcm2ps#abcm2ps in section ">sec:PolyphonicMusic</a>.

<P>
Slurs and ties within chords are possible:
